# Deprecation Note: 
#  Ansible no longer suggests using these environment variables for credentails
#  now users should use the connection: network_cli method for network devices 
#  and use the parameters there.

# Though the use of these environment variables may still work. Timing for removing 
# their functionality from Ansible is undetermined.
